Measured by steps taken, it was tall. Measured by ideas discussed, things learned, and sights seen, it was towering.</p><p><img src="/images/falls.bcca.jpg" alt="Hanakapi'ai Falls"></p><p>For the past week and a half I’ve been trapped on an island among a team of brilliant hackers. A curious duality exists on the island. At sunrise, stand-up paddleboard yoga is followed naturally by a technical stand-up meeting. A group huddling around a laptop for hours may swiftly disband upon noticing big surf. This isn’t an idle vacation, nor is it daunting contract work. We’re nineteen people fervently working toward a noble goal in a stress-free mind amphitheater.</p><h2 id="trust-on-first-use">Trust on first use</h2><p>Coming here was a leap of faith. Before leaving, friends and family were incredulous:</p><blockquote><p>So they’re going to fly you to Hawaii. And give you a surfboard. And teach you things. So that you can work on a project that you wanted to work on anyway?</p></blockquote><p>Though it sounded too good to be true, sparse details soon surfaced in our inboxes:</p><blockquote><p>This is your plane ticket. This is our house. This is who will pick you up.</p></blockquote><p>We arrived in Hawaii with backpacks and a vague idea of what the next two weeks would hold. The uncertainty distilled a group of self-motivated people who <em>really</em> wanted to pitch in. The lack of granular detail allowed us to fill in gaps and make the trip our own.</p><p><img src="/images/shave-ice.878f.jpg" alt="Kauai's Best Shave Ice"></p><h2 id="an-activist-an-anarchist-and-an-astrophysicist-walk-into-a-bar">An activist, an anarchist, and an astrophysicist walk into a bar…</h2><p>One of the best parts of this trip has been the conversation. The group brings a wide range of perspectives, each passionate and thoughtful. While discussing the nebulous moral code of young countries over dinner, someone asked:</p><blockquote><p>Okay, but what does “free will” even mean?</p></blockquote><p>There was an outcry,</p><blockquote><p>“Woah, come on, don’t ask a question like that!”</p></blockquote><p>a pause, then:</p><blockquote><p>“we have to save <em>something</em> to talk about tomorrow!”</p></blockquote><p>The most important part of an experience like this is having interesting people to share it with. On this trip, we’ve got ‘em in spades.</p><h2 id="body-and-mind">Body and mind</h2><p>Since arriving I’ve restructured the browser extension’s event system and kayaked beside a family of sea-turtles. The day that I watched a rainstorm pass by while Lilia played ukulele was the same day that I allowed multiple conversation instances to open concurrently. If there was any uncertainty it’s long gone now, replaced by a fulfillment that stretches far beyond these two weeks.</p><p><img src="/images/sunset.8962.jpg" alt="Sunset on Kalalau Trail"></p></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_shortname = 'rileyjshaw';
